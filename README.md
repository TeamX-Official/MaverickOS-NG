# What is MaverickOS NG?
 M.OS is a next generation operating system which simplifies tasks such as starting a program, see your files and do simple tasks such as taking notes.

# Why NG?
 Because it isn't our first try.
 We already did 2 OS before (LataOSX and MaverickOS).
 This OS is developed for simplicity, modernity and functionalities.
